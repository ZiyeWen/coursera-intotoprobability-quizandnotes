## Question 1: Which of the following explains the phenomenon that while in 10 flips of a fair coin it may not be very surprising to get 8 Heads, it would be very surprising to get 8,000 Heads in 10,000 flips of the coin.
# Law of large numbers

## Question 2: Shown below are four Venn diagrams. In which of the diagrams does the shaded area represent A and B and C?
# 

## Question 3: Each choice below shows a suggested probability distribution for letter grades in a class (Possible grades are A, B, C, or D or lower). Determine which is a proper probability distribution.
# A: 0.30, B: 0.30, C: 0.40, D or lower: 0
# Because they add up to 1 and there is no negative probability

## Question 3: Which of the following is false about probability distributions?
# The outcomes listed must be independent.

## Question 4: Assortative mating is a nonrandom mating pattern where individuals with similar genotypes and/or phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than what would be expected under a random mating pattern. Researchers studying this topic collected data on eye colors of 204 Scandinavian men and their female partners. The table below summarizes the results. For simplicity, assume heterosexual relationships. What is the probability that a randomly chosen couple is comprised of a male and female with blue eyes?
# WRONG: (108+114−78)/204
# Which is couples with male with blue eyes, plus couples with female with blue eyes, minus couples with both having blue eyes (because they are accounted for twice before)

## Question 4: Last semester, out of 170 students taking a particular statistics class, 71 students were “majoring” in social sciences and 53 students were majoring in pre-medical studies. There were 6 students who were majoring in both pre-medical studies and social sciences. What is the probability that a randomly chosen student is majoring in social sciences, given that s/he is majoring in pre-medical studies?
# Students can be:
#    - social science -> 71
#        - only -> 65
#        - and pre-medical -> 6
#    - pre-medical -> 53
#        - only -> 47
#        - and social science -> 6
# We are looking for p(both | pre-medical) =
#                    p(both & pre-medical) / p(pre-medical) =
#                    6 / (6+47) = 6/53
# 6/53

## Question 5: Which of the following is false?
# If two events (both with probability greater than 0) are mutually exclusive, they could be independent.
# 2nd round FALSE: Two mutually exclusive outcomes (of the same event) cannot occur at the same time.
# 3rd round: FALSE: Two complementary outcomes (of the same event) cannot occur at the same time.

# 0.114823

## Question 8: About 24% of flights departing from New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport were delayed in 2009. Assuming that the chance of a flight being delayed has stayed constant at 24%, we are interested in finding the probability of 10 out of the next 100 departing flights being delayed. Noting that if one flight is delayed, the next flight is more likely to be delayed, which of the following statements is correct?
# We cannot calculate this probability using the binomial distribution since whether or not one flight is delayed is not independent of another.

## Question 8: You are about to take a multi-day tour through a national park which is famous for its wildlife. The tour guide tells you that on any given day there’s a 61% chance that a visitor will see at least one “big game” animal, and a 39% chance they’ll see no big game animals; when the tour guide says “big game”, he refers to either a moose or a bear. The guide assures you that big game sightings on a single day are independent of any other day’s sightings. Given the information from the tour guide, which of the following calculations cannot be performed using a binomial distribution?
# Calculate the probability that you see at least 4 big game animals on the first day of a 5-day trip.

## Question 9: Which of the following, on its own, is the least useful method for assessing if the data follow a normal distribution?

At any given time about 5.5% of women (age 15-45) are pregnant. A home pregnancy test is accurate 99% of the time if the woman taking the test is actually pregnant and 99.5% accurate if the woman is not pregnant. If the test yields a positive result, what is the posterior probability of the hypothesis that the woman is pregnant?
# Let Probability that women is pregnant, P(A) = 0.055
# Probability that women is not pregnant, P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.055 = 0.945
# Also, Let B be the event that test is positive;
# Probability that pregnancy test is positive given that the woman is actually pregnant, P(B/A) = 0.99
# Probability that pregnancy test is positive given that the woman is not actually pregnant, P(B/A') = 1 - 0.995 = 0.005
# Now, we have to find that if the test yields a positive result what is the posterior probability that the woman is pregnant i.e.; P(A/B)
# Using Bayes' Theorem we get
# P(A/B) =(P(A)*P(B|A))/((P(A)*P(B|A)+ P(A')*P(B/A') )=0.92


Your boss is a biologist who needs wood samples from long-leaf pine trees with a fungal disease which is only visible under a microscope, and she sends you on an assignment to collect the samples. She wants at least 50 different diseased samples. She tells you that approximately 28% of long-leaf pine trees currently have the fungal disease. If you sample 160 long-leaf pine trees at random, what is the probability you’ll have at least 50 diseased samples to return to your boss?
# μ=np=160*0.28=44.8
# σ=\sqrt{npq} = \sqrt{160*0.28*(1-0.72)} = 5.7
# P(x≥50)=1-P(x<50)
# P(x<50), z=(50-44.8)/5.7=0.91, using table P(x<50)=0.81859
# P(x≥50)=1-0.81859=0.18


About 30% of human twins are identical, and the rest are fraternal. Identical twins are necessarily the same sex, half are males and the other half are females. One-quarter of fraternal twins are both male, one-quarter both female, and one-half are mixes: one male, one female. You have just become a parent of twins and are told they are both girls. Given this information, what is the probability that they are identical?
# Twins can be:
#    - identical -> 30%
#        - boys -> 50%
#        - girls -> 50%
#    - different -> 70%
#        - boys -> 25%
#        - girls -> 25%
#        - both -> 50%
# We are looking for p(identical | two girls) =
#                    p(identical & two girls) / p(two girls) =
#                    30%*50% / (30%*50% + 70%*25%)
0.30*0.50 / (0.30*0.50 + 0.70*0.25)
# 0.4615385

More than three-quarters of the nation’s colleges and universities now offer online classes, and about 23% of college graduates have taken a course online. 39% of those who have taken a course online believe that online courses provide the same educational value as one taken in person, a view shared by only 27% of those who have not taken an online course. At a coffee shop you overhear a recent college graduate discussing that she doesn’t believe that online courses provide the same educational value as one taken in person. What’s the probability that she has taken an online course before?
# A college graduate can:
#    - take a course online -> 23%
#        - same value -> 39%
#        - less value -> 61%
#    - not take a course online -> 77%
#        - same value -> 27%
#        - less value -> 73%
# We are looking for p(course online | same value) =
#                    p(course online & same value)) / p(same value) =
#                    23%*39% / (23%*39% + 77%*27%)
0.23*0.39 / (0.23*0.39 + 0.77*0.27)
# FALSE: 0.3014113
# I should have calculated p(course online | NOT same value), which is what was asked
# p(course online | not same value) =
# p(course online & not same value)) / p(not same value) =
# 23%*61% / (23%*61% + 77%*73%)
0.23*0.61 / (0.23*0.61 + 0.77*0.73)
# 0.1997437


One strange phenomenon that sometimes occurs at U.S. airport security gates is that an otherwise law-abiding passenger is caught with a gun in his/her carry-on bag. Usually the passenger claims he/she forgot to remove the handgun from a rarely-used bag before packing it for airline travel. It’s estimated that every day 3,000,000 gun owners fly on domestic U.S. flights. Suppose the probability a gun owner will mistakenly take a gun to the airport is 0.00001. What is the probability that tomorrow more than 35 domestic passengers will accidentally get caught with a gun at the airport? Choose the closest answer.
sum(dbinom(36:3000000, size =3000000, prob = 0.00001))
# 0.1573823
# Alternative method using normal approximation
n <- 3000000
p <- 0.00001
# Let's check we can use normal approximation
n * p >= 10
n * (1-p) >= 10
# Both are true, here we go!
m <- n * p
sd <- sqrt(n * p * (1-p))
# We look for "more", not "at least" 35 passengers! 
1-pnorm(q = 36 - 0.5, mean = m, sd = sd)
# 0.15765
# Result: 0.18
